        <h1>Milanesa</h1>
        <img src="../img/milanesa.jpg" alt="It's a Milanesa, like beef with breadcrumbs LOL">
        <p><strong>Similar to the Austrian wiener schnitzel, the Italian cotoletta alla Milanese, and the Japanese tonkatsu, the Argentinian milanesa is also a breaded cutlet shallow-fried in oil. The cutlet typically comes either from the round or from the eye of the round, which are lean cuts, meaning they have less fat, marbling, and sinew when compared to most other cuts of beef. Besides beef, milanesa can also be prepared with veal, pork, or be made vegetarian by using soy cutlets or eggplant instead. The first step when preparing milanesa is to prepare the meat, which means removing any fat or sinew to get as clean of cutlets as possible, which are then pounded with a mallet until a half a centimeter thick. The cutlets are then first dipped typically in a mixture of beaten eggs, chopped garlic, parsley, salt, and pepper, but, depending on the recipe, this mixture can also include mustard. Once soaked in the egg mixture, the cutlets are dredged in breadcrumbs and then shallow-fried in a pan until golden. The milanesa should be served warm, with just a drizzle of lemon juice and a side of mashed potatoes or fries. In Argentina, they also have variations on the basic milanesa, such as caballo, which is milanesa topped with an egg and milanesa a la napolitana, which has a topping of tomato salsa, ham, and mozzarella cheese.</strong></p>
